A self-contained, *self-modifying* flashcards webapp. Flashcard programs are a dime a dozen, but this one's a quine:

* Add a card deck and fill it up with cards.
* Study the cards with a simple interface.
* When you're done, press the "save" button. The program will print out its own sourcecode with your modified flashcards baked in.

Turns out quines actually do have a practical use...?

You can study on anything with a web browser, no dedicated app needed. Because the HTML file has no external dependencies, studying can be performed offline and you can share it with friends.
